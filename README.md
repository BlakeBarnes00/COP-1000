# COP-1000
This is my repository for my COP-1000 course at [Lake-Sumter State College](https://www.lssc.edu/) for my Computer Science Associates. 

I have been learning programming on and off since 2014 starting with learning how to make small games using [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/), and then after that trying to learn other languages but never stuck to a single one itself, so I do not *know* a language per say, how ever I do understand a few of them and also have the concepts of them down. This course uses [Python](https://www.python.org/), a language that I am very interested in and honestly really excited to learn using [Starting Out with Python 4th Edition](https://www.pearson.com/store/p/starting-out-with-python-student-value-edition/P100001432083/9780134543666).

## Sources I used for learning
I used a lot of sources outside of the [Starting Out with Python 4th Edition](https://www.pearson.com/store/p/starting-out-with-python-student-value-edition/P100001432083/9780134543666) text-book. Notebly the [Official Python Discord](https://discord.gg/python), Stack-Overflow, and Various sources on Reddit such as [/r/Python/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/), [/r/learnprogramming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/), and [/r/learnpython/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/). And also the [Python 3 Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/).



<sub>There is obviously a huge part of these lessons that were done in the [MyProgrammingLab](https://mlm.pearson.com/northamerica/myprogramminglab/) website itself. Personally I did not feel the need to completely compile the work I did for the small files as a lot of them simply would just raise errors or warnings and annoy me visually in Visual Studio Code, I am sure people understand that inconvienence of seeing yellow or red lines.</sub>

# COP-1000
____
This is my repository for my COP-1000 course at [Lake-Sumter State College](https://www.lssc.edu/) for my Computer Science Associates. 

I have been learning programming on and off since 2014 starting with learning how to make small games using [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/), and then after that trying to learn other languages but never stuck to a single one itself, so I do not *know* a language per say, how ever I do understand a few of them and also have the concepts of them down. This course uses [Python](https://www.python.org/), a language that I am very interested in and honestly really excited to learn using [Starting Out with Python 4th Edition](https://www.pearson.com/store/p/starting-out-with-python-student-value-edition/P100001432083/9780134543666).
